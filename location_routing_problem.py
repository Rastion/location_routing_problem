    Location Routing Problem (LRP) for Qubots.
    
    In the LRP, a fleet of vehicles (with uniform capacity) must serve a set of customers using one of several depots.
    Each depot has an opening cost and a capacity, and each customer has a demand.
    Vehicles (trucks) follow routes that start and end at their assigned depot.
    
    A candidate solution is represented as a dictionary with:
      - "routes": a list (of length nb_trucks) where each element is a list of customer indices (0-indexed)
                  indicating the order in which a truck visits customers.
      - "depot_assignment": a list (of length nb_trucks) where each element is a depot index (0-indexed) 
                  assigned to the corresponding truck.
    
    The objective is to minimize the total cost, defined as the sum of:
      - For each used route: the fixed opening route cost plus the travel distance (from the depot to the first customer,
        between consecutive customers, and from the last customer back to the depot).
      - For each depot that serves at least one route: its opening cost.
    
    Additionally, the total demand served by any truck must not exceed the vehicle capacity,
    and the sum of demands served by trucks assigned to a depot must not exceed that depot's capacity.

          - The first two numbers: number of customers and number of depots.
          - Next, for each depot: two integers for its x and y coordinates.
          - Then, for each customer: two integers for its x and y coordinates.
